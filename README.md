# Personal-Chatbot-Project
Developed an interactive chatbot capable of answering user queries and learning from new inputs. The chatbot uses a knowledge base stored in a JSON file, which it can update based on user interaction.

* Requires the creation of a JSON file in your code editor along with
code:  {
    "questions": []
   }
  This is where the responses you teach the chatbot are stored.
